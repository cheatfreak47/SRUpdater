<TABLE BORDER> 
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/ring.JPG"></TD><Th>Rings</Th><TD>
These are "key" to your success in the game. You need to collect a<br>
different amount per course. How many do you need? Why do you<br>
need them? Telling would be cheating! Maybe you'll just need to<br>
look around and find out for yourself.<br>
</Th></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/item.JPG"></TD><Th>Item Panel</Th><TD>
This red, yellow and blue item will come in handy, so be sure to pick it<br>
up as you run around the course. There are different powers your<br>
character gains for a short time when you run through an Item Panel.<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/speed.JPG"></TD><Th>Fleet Feet</Th><TD>
Fleet Feet increases your character's speed. As if your character wasn't<br>
fast enough already!<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/aqua.JPG"></TD><Th>Water Shield</Th><TD>
With a Water Shield (blue sphere), you can walk or run on water!<br>
Keep in mind that you can only use the shield once, so use it wisely!<br> 
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/thunder.JPG"></TD><Th>Lightning Shield</Th><TD>
When a Lightning Shield (yellow sphere) appears around your character,<br>
there is no need to touth the Rings. Just run by them and the Lightning<br>
Shield will suck them in! Remember that falling in the water makes the<br> 
shield disappear.<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/5ring.JPG"></TD><Th>Big 5 Ring</Th><TD>5 rings will be added to your Ring count.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/10ring.JPG"></TD><Th>Big 10 Ring</Th><TD>10 rings will be added to your Ring count.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/20ring.JPG"></TD><Th>Big 20 Ring</Th><TD>20 rings will be added to your Ring count.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/gate.JPG"></TD><Th>Ring Gate</Th><TD>
This gate will be open only if you have enough rings for the number displayed <br>
above it. Through this, you may take a short cut, or may find Chaos Emeralds......<br> 
Ring Gate is also "key".<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/warp.JPG"></TD><Th>Accelerators</Th><TD>
Run through an Accelerator and you are propelled forward at an<br>
unbelievable speed. Of course, riding this high-tech wonder machine<br>
will require a fee in Rings. The more rings you have, the further<br>
the Accelerator will send you.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">
Keep in mind that your rings will run out with Warp System.When you want to<br> 
save your rings, you better avoid it.<br>
</font></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/tokun.JPG"></TD><Th>Sonic Tokens</Th><TD>
Find the five Sonic Tokens located on each course. Gather all of them,<br>
continue to run, and something rather unexpected might happen.<br>
The search is well worth the effort.<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><img src= "../item/chaos.JPG"></TD><Th>Chaos Emeralds</Th><TD>
And what would a Sonic game bo without Chaos Emeralds? Race around the<br> 
tracks to find the Emeralds, but only the best racers can keep them.<br>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE><br>
<b>Checking Chaos Emeralds</b><br>
You will check the Chaos Emeralds your character has collected so far from the LOAD/ SAVE DATA of<br> 
the option menu.<br>
