<b>Safety precautions</b><br>
1. A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures<br> 
when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns<br> 
or backgrounds on a television screen or while playing video games may induce an epileptic<br> 
seizure in these individuals. Certain conditions may induce undetected epileptic symptoms<br> 
even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. If you, or anyone in<br> 
your family, has an epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to playing.<br> 
If you experience any of the following symptoms while playing a video game - dizziness,<br>
altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary<br> 
movement or convulsions - IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming play.<br>
