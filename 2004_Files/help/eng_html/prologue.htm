<font size="4">Sonic and Knuckles are enjoying a little time off
from adventuring. The trip they have planned<br>
will be a nice, relaxing vacation. Or so they think...<br>
<br>
Tails spots a huge sign alongside the road they are currently
traveling on. It is a recruiting<br>
advertisement for the World Grand Prix. &quot;Sonic! Sonic! Look,
there's going to be a huge race<br>
with all the best racers in the world. What a great opportunity
for you to show your speed and<br>
compete with the other great runners!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sonic thinks for a moment. He's the world's fastest runner, but
participating in races is not really<br>
his interest. Something on the sign, however, catches Sonic's
eye. Dr. Robotnik, Sonic's arch-enemy,<br>
is participating in the race. Sonic races off into the distance.
&quot;Wait Sonic! Wait for me!&quot;<br>
Tails shouts to his friend.<br>
<br>
Miles above the sign, a spy satellite focuses on Sonic and Tails.
Dr. Robotnik snickers in delight.<br>
&quot;Now that you have fallen into my trap, Sonic, I will
finally have the Chaos Emeralds, and beat<br>
you at the same time. With my new hover machine, and
these...&quot; Dr. Robotnik looks to his left,<br>
and a row of gleaming eyes gaze back at him. &quot;Nothing can go
wrong! Hahahahahahaha.....&quot;<br>
Little does Sonic know that Dr. Robotnik has learned of the
location of the Chaos Emeralds.<br>
<br>
Sonic is not the only one who will be racing with Dr. Robotnik.
Sonic's rival, Knuckles, has<br>
learned that Sonic will be participating in a very important
race. Knuckles never turns down a<br>
chance to be around Sonic when the action starts.<br>
<br>
Amy will be there too. After secretly overhearing Dr. Robotnik's
plans, she also will be<br>
racing to find the Chaos Emeralds.<br>
In Sonic R, you get the chance to be one of the five Sonic
characters in a four-course 3D race.<br>
Race quickly, but remember to look for items which will help you
along your way. And lastly,<br>
find those Chaos Emeralds!<br>
