To install, first install the Sonic R Mod Loader. If you don't already have it, I'd use CheatFreak's Sonic R Updater at https://gamebanana.com/tools/6325.

Once that is all set up, extract this ZIP into the mods/ directory so that mod.ini and SonicR_ColorFix.dll are located at [game install path]/mods/SaturnColors/*. That's it!
