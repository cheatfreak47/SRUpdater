; Development Notes
; -----------------
; Tracks 2 and 12-17 re all ripped from the Sega Saturn port. (Thanks for the time MainMemory!)
; - Track2 because the PC version simply trimmed about 2 seconds from the Saturn Title Screen
; - Tracks 12-17 because the PC Versions of the instrumental tracks are the same up until a certain point where the Saturn versions simply have additional music.

; Track5 (Options Menu Theme) features the only "perfect loop". (that is to say, it could be achieved without editing or loss of any music.)
; - Loop Type: Native Loop
; - Start Loop: 42,366 Samples
; - End Loop: 2,026,418 Samples
