![Image of SRUpdater](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheatfreak47/SRUpdater/master/repo.png))
Sonic R Updater is an in-development patch for the 1998 port of Sonic R.
This patch will update the game to the much more friendly 2004 port, with the [Sonic R Mod Loader](https://github.com/sonicretro/sonicr-mod-loader/releases) included, along with a couple of small fix mods; ADX Music and RemoveStrays.

### F.A.Q.
**Q:** Is this speedrun legal?

**A:** Not officially... [yet...](https://www.speedrun.com/Sonic_R/thread/zc91h) ...but technically it _should be._ Neither ADX Music or RemoveStrays are code based mods, and thus have no effect on how the game performs or behaves in anyway outside of extremely minor cosmetic differences in UI and Audio Quality. The only changes to the game made by Sonic R Mod Loader are also purely cosmetic, save for fixing a bug that caused terrible framerates on any modern Windows OS, which I think should get a pass for making the game behave like it's supposed to, and the cause is the OS, not the game.


**Q:** 2004 port? Why haven't I heard of this before?

**A:** It's just really obscure and quite rare, only being released in limitied quantities in the UK and Australia (to our current knowledge, at least) and with the boxes not even labeled accordingly, that makes tracking copies down rather difficult.
